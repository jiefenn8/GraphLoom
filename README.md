# r2graph-api

Part of component (1/3) (CONVERT) of web-semantics parent side project (TBA).


A relational database to RDF graph map API. Mapping relational database from a provided interface to RDF triples resulting in an accessible RDF output dataset graph. The current implementation will follow relatively to [W3C R2RML Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2graph.r2rml "r2graph.r2rml.R2RML: RDB to RDF Mapping Language - 27 September 2012").

Implementation of any presistent database store handling of the RDF output graph will not be included in this component.
